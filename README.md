PackedWool addresses the lack of woollike decorative blocks. Tho along the development i have
decided to add additional functionality that always can be disabled via config.

The mod is designed to be as non-invasive as it is possible using forge API. Current features of the mod are:
- 16 new woollike blocks.
- Changed bed recipe/s.

It is planned to add:
- Giant sheep as a rare friendly mob that might occur.
- Additional 16 woollike blocks with different pattern for each.
- Packed wool slab variants.
- Packed wool carpet variants.
- Make the normal wool act differently... :) .
- Single wool and packed wool which in instead can be colored in rgb.

### The Goal
- Introduce few new decorative blocks and give more purpose to wool.
- Slow down the access of minecraft beds.
- Provide a shared programming interface for shears and shearable blocks.

### Config
Those settings can be changed inside the config file:
- Option to disable overriding shears by this mod. (It's doing it to make other blocks sherable as wool).
- Option to replace all the bed recipes with a recipe for a single bed which is the original red bed.
- Option to disable new bed recipes introduced by this mod.
- Not Yet. Option to disable packed wool recipes.
- Not yet. Option to specify materials that are shearable. 
- Not yet. Option to specify blocks that are shearable.
