PackedWool addresses the lack of woollike decorative blocks. Tho along the development i have
decided to add additional functionality that always can be disabled via config.

The mod is designed to be as non invasive as it is possible using forge API. Current features of the mod are:
- 16 new woollike blocks.
- Changed bed recipe/s.

It is planned to add:
- a giant sheep as a rare friendly mob.
- additional 16 woollike blocks with different pattern for each.
- packed wool slab variants.
- packed wool carpet variants.
- make the normal wool act a little different.. :) 

### The Goal
- Introduce few new decorative blocks and give purpose to wool.
- Slow down the access of minecraft beds.
- Provide a shared programming interface for shears and shearable blocks.

### Config
Those settings can be changed inside the config file:
- Option to disable overriding shears by this mod. (It's doing it to make other blocks sherable as wool).
- Option to replace all the bed recipes with a recipe for a single bed which is the original red bed.
- Option to disable new bed recipes introduced by this mod.
- Not Yet. Option to disable packed wool recipes.
- Not yet. Option to specify materials that are shearable. 
- Not yet. Option to specify blocks that are shearable.
