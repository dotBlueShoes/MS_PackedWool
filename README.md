PackedWool is a small minecraft mod which basically just adds few new woollike blocks.

### The Goal
- Slow down the access of minecraft beds. 
- Introduce few new decorative blocks.

### Config
Those settings can be changed inside the config file:
- Not Yet. Option to replace all bed recipes with one recipe for a bed called "Legacy Bed" which is the original red bed.
- Not Yet. Option to fully disable new recipes intoroduced by this mod.  
- Option to disable overriding shears by this mod. (It's doing it to make Packed Wool sherable as wool).
