// Here's what's going wrong
// PackedWool class has to be changed.
// The enum has to be in it as well as logic to it.
// it can be viewed in "BlockWoodSlab", "BlockPlanks",
// classes for example.

// 1.0.0.0 
// - shears-lib functionality
// materials for shears. (different speeds, durability)
// shearable blocklist. (additionally a check with all the current loaded blocks)


1. [Jitpack publishing](https://jitpack.io/) 
**I am done with it. pls help if u can. Still it's a minor feature**
//4. Think about what's here and what's in 1.13+ versions.
7. Giant Sheep

// Scaling entities.
// https://github.com/the-realest-stu/Lilliputian

// Creating a new entity
// https://wiki.mcjty.eu/modding/index.php?title=Mobs-1.12

// Both ways seem a little too much
//  there's prob. something in between that can be used
//  to create a mob of a sheep model that will be 1.5 size of original.

8. Make it so packedWool can be only collected with shears otherwise the player gets 3 wool.
9. PackedWool decorative variants (terracotta style).
10. Make normal wool act as spider web (the player will fall into the block)
11. It also spawns spring-web like particles upon moving through.
12. Take care of advancements.
13. Mod integration with "davinci".
14. Singular wool / packed wool and all their variants that can be colored in all colors.
15. Fix advancements upon world loading.

16. Slab recipes. Make Serious Recipes give 2 instead of 3.
17. Implement other stairs (rename the models so they have same name conv of blockstates.)
18. Implement "getItemBlock()" methods
