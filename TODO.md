## MS_PackedWool 1.12.2 Dev ToDo List
### Main
- [ ] Change creative tab apperance (they're not in the same order as wool is).
- [ ] Remove EmptyRecipe class "comment it inside CraftingHandler".
- [ ] Try making the textures slightly darker.
- [ ] [Jitpack publishing](https://jitpack.io/)
- [x] (actually no) Change revision and build order. The thing is i would have set revision to 0 when i build.
### ShearsLib
- [ ] Implement blocks material - harvest lvl etc (look at serious_core project).
- [ ] Think about making packed wool long to harvest and drop wool instead. And when harvested with shears it would drop packed wool.
- [ ] Make shears extensible (different speeds for different shear material).
- [ ] Include Shers into the project.
